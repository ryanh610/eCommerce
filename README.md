# eCommerce
  ## Description

  For this project, I have created an e-commerce back end that lets users view, edit, and delete data from their mysql database. I have utilized my knowledge in sequelize to fulfil this task. My method of completing such a function relied heavily on using the CRUD functions to manipulate the backend API and present the object information to the user.
